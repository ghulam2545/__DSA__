Sorting Algorithm---

--> Selection Sort :
select minium element from left hand and shift this in right hand, again select minium element (form remaining element) and shift to hand (at the end);


--> Bubble Sort :
compare first two adjecent element (swap if need), do this for next two and so on, at first pass max element will be bubbled up.


--> Insertion Sort :
first element consider as sorted and remaining as unsorted, pick first element form unsorted and place it in sorted part at right place.


--> Merge Sort :
--> Quick Sort :



these problem can be solved by using (merge sort, quick sort) technique

// Given a binary array, sort it in linear time and constant space. The output should print all zeroes, followed by all ones.

// Given an array of positive and negative integers, segregate them in linear time and constant space. The output should print
// all negative numbers, followed by all positive numbers.

// Given an integer array, rearrange it such that it contains positive and negative numbers at alternate positions.
// If the array contains more positive or negative elements, move them to the end of the array.

// Given an integer array, move all zeros present in it to the end. The solution should maintain the relative order of items in the array.
